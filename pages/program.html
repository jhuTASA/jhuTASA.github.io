                            <p>While simultaneously inspiring the attendees to dream big and get back to sketching their
                                own path, we hope to inspire them to set healthy and free expectations on those they
                                support. By identifying the expectations that have caused them stress and redefining how
                                to fulfill these expectations, the attendees will be able to use their unique experience
                                as Taiwanese Americans and to inspire and support people around them to sketch their own
                                path.</p>
